## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- NextJs
- TailwindCSS
  -Framer-motion

### What I learned

This one was a fun challenge, I enjoyed using framer-motion to animate the mobile menu, and to figure out the best way to go about darkening the rest of the content when the menu was visible.

I initially tried to use CSS Grid to lay out the desktop version, but I was having a hard time getting it to line up just right, so I switched over to Flexbox.
